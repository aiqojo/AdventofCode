i did continue after day 6, just lazy no updates here

## 2021

Probably the up there for some of the most unoptimized and needlessly complicated code out there for Advent of Code 2021.

But here it is.

I'll try to keep comments on this and make it somewhat make sense, but only time will tell.

~~I'm planning on doing all of these in C++ and hopefully if I have time, translating them to Python too, but yet again, no idea if that will ever happen.~~
I've decided to not be a masochist and switch to Python.

**UPDATE:** I stopped at around Day 18 or something, will fix this up and add all of my other stuff in the soon future.
